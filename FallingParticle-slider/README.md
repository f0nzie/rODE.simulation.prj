# FallingParticle-slider
This is the proof of concept of real-time animation of Ordinary Differential Equations using R Shiny.

It uses a slider to provide the steps. It is good enough to test the concept but it is not flexible enough.

## What it cannot do
* Stop at the end of the simulation cycle
* Reset to a new simulation
* Able to reset and request a new set of inputs such as $\delta t$.
